# 💼 Business Toolkit (Strategy Engine)

## Purpose
To define the **Commercial & Operational Logic** of the product.
Combines "Market Context" (External) with "Business Rules" (Internal).

## 🧠 Thinking Logic (How to Execute)

### A. Pricing & Monetization
1.  **Identify Model:** Is this SaaS (Recurring), Marketplace (Take-rate), or One-time?
2.  **Benchmark:** Find 3 competitors. List their pricing tiers side-by-side.
3.  **Find the Gate:** What feature forces the upgrade from Free to Pro?
4.  **Recommend:** Define our model based on the "Wedge" (Undercut price or Over-deliver value).

### B. Business Process Logic (As-Is vs To-Be)
1.  **Map Current State:** Use `INTERVIEW_QUESTIONNAIRE` data to draw the "As-Is" flow.
2.  **Highlight Friction:** Mark steps that are "Manual" or "Slow".
3.  **Design Future State:** Remove the friction steps using software automation.
4.  **Verify Compliance:** Does this new flow break any rules (GAAP, HIPAA)?

### C. Market Analysis (The "Why")
1.  **Size the Prize:** Is this a niche or a mass market?
2.  **Identify Trends:** What is changing *right now* (e.g., AI adoption)?
3.  **SWOT:** Compare our Strength against Competitor Weakness.
