# 💎 Product Toolkit (Experience Engine)

## Purpose
To define the **User Experience** and **Feature Value**.
Combines "Voice of Customer" (VoC) with "UX Benchmarks" to write "User Stories".

## 🧠 Thinking Logic (How to Execute)

### A. Voice of Customer (VoC) Analysis
1.  **Search:** Go to Reddit/G2/AppStore. Search `"[Competitor] sucks"` or `"[Problem] solved"`.
2.  **Filter:** Ignore "Support" complaints. Find "Feature" complaints (e.g., "Why can't I export?").
3.  **Synthesize:** Group complaints into "Themes" (e.g., "Friction", "Cost", "Missing Feat").
4.  **Wedge:** Define how We solve this (e.g., "1-click Export").

### B. UX Benchmarking (The "Delighters")
1.  **Identify Flow:** What is the critical path? (e.g., Onboarding).
2.  **Find Best-in-Class:** Look at Mobbin/PageFlows for the top 3 apps (e.g., Linear, Airbnb).
3.  **Isolate Patterns:** What makes them good? (Speed? Animation? Copy?).
4.  **Adopt:** Write a requirement to mimic that pattern.

### C. Agile Definition (User Stories)
1.  **Actor:** Who is doing it? (Persona).
2.  **Action:** What are they doing? (Feature).
3.  **Value:** Why? (The "So That..." clause).
4.  **Verification:** Write 3 Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then).
