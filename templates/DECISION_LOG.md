## Usage Guidelines

1. **Log immediately** - Don't wait, capture while fresh
2. **Include context** - Future readers need to understand WHY
3. **Link related items** - Connect to requirements/specs
4. **Review in retros** - Validate decisions still hold
5. **Mark superseded** - When decisions change, link to new decision
