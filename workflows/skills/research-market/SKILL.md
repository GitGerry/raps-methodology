## Executive Summary

**Market Size (TAM):** $X billion (Year)
**Growth Rate:** X% CAGR
**Key Trend:** [One-line trend summary]
**Opportunity:** [One-line opportunity statement]

## Market Sizing

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
**$X billion** (Year)

**Calculation:**
```
[Number of potential customers] × [Average annual spend]
= X million customers × $Y/year
= $X billion
```

**Sources:**
- [Source 1]
- [Source 2]

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
**$X billion** (Year)

**Adjustments:**
- Geographic focus: [Region] → X% of TAM
- Segment focus: [Segment] → X% of TAM
- SAM = TAM × X% = $X billion

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
**$X million** (Year 1)

**Realistic Capture:**
- Year 1: X% of SAM = $X million
- Year 3: X% of SAM = $X million
- Year 5: X% of SAM = $X million
