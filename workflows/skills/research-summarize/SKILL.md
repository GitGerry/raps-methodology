# Summarize Research Skill

## Purpose
Transform lengthy documents, research papers, articles, and other sources into concise, actionable summaries with key takeaways.

## When to Use
- Distilling long research documents
- Summarizing multiple sources into one report
- Creating executive briefings
- Condensing technical papers for non-technical audience
- Preparing handoff summaries

---

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Source Material
- What document(s) are we summarizing?
- Who is the target audience?
- What decisions will this inform?

### 2. Read and Extract

#### For Each Source
1. **Main thesis/purpose** - What is this about?
2. **Key arguments/findings** - 3-5 most important points
3. **Evidence quality** - How credible is this?
4. **Relevance to project** - How does this apply to us?
5. **Actionable insights** - What should we do with this?

### 3. Synthesize Across Sources
- Common themes
- Contradictions
- Gaps
- Consensus

### 4. Structure Output
- Executive summary (1-2 paragraphs)
- Key findings (bullet points)
- Supporting details (organized sections)
- Implications (what it means for us)
- Source credibility assessment
